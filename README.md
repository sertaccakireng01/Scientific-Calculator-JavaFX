Scientific Calculator (JavaFX & Shunting-Yard Algorithm)

This is a comprehensive scientific calculator developed as part of my Advanced Java Programming course. 
The project focuses on handling complex mathematical evaluations through robust algorithms and a clean, responsive user interface, earning a 90% grade.

Key Features:

Complex Expression Parsing: Capable of evaluating long mathematical strings with multiple operators and nested parentheses.

Operator Precedence: Accurately handles the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).

Scientific Functions: Supports advanced calculations beyond basic arithmetic.

Interactive GUI: A modern desktop interface built with JavaFX and Gluon SceneBuilder.

Error Handling: Robust management of invalid mathematical inputs and syntax errors.

Technical Highlights:

Shunting-Yard Algorithm: Implemented this classic algorithm to parse infix notations into Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).

Data Structures: Heavily utilized Stacks to process tokens and manage operator precedence during calculation.

MVC Architecture: Followed the Model-View-Controller design pattern to ensure high code maintainability and separation of logic.

Event-Driven Programming: Managed complex GUI event handling to ensure a seamless user experience.

The primary challenge of this project was correctly interpreting user input as a mathematical expression. 
By implementing a stack-based logic for the Shunting-Yard algorithm, I gained deep insights into how data structures are applied in real-world software. 
This 2-person group project was an excellent exercise in both algorithmic thinking and GUI design.
