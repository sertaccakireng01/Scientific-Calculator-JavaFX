This project is a scientific calculator that I developed using Java, JavaFX and Gluon SceneBuilder. The main challenge was to make sure the calculator could handle complex mathematical expressions with correct operator precedence.
To solve this, I implemented the Shunting-yard algorithm to convert expressions into Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), using stack-based logic to process everything from simple addition to nested parentheses.
I used Gluon SceneBuilder to design the interface, following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern to keep the code organized and maintainable. 
It was a great way to practice event handling and see how data structures work in a real-world application. This was a 2-person group project and we were quite happy with the result, scoring a 90% grade.
